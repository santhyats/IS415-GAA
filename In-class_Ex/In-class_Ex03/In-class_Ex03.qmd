When we need to use packages that have been retired, we can download them from archives. In this example below I am downloading fro posit package manager. The date indicates the version of the package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages ("maptools",
                  repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

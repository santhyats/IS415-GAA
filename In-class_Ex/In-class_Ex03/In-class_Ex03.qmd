When we need to use packages that have been retired, we can download them from archives. In this example below I am downloading fro posit package manager. The date indicates the version of the package.

However, it is not recommended to use retired packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages ("maptools",
                  repos = "https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2023-10-13")
```

This code is used to derive the coastal outline sf tibble data frame. We don't need the coastal outline dataframe if we are going by this method.

```{r}
sg_sf <- mpsz_sf %>% st_union()
plot(sg_sf)
```

Loading in data for Take Home 3

```{r}
acled_sf <- read_csv("data/ACLED_Myanmar.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
           crs = 4326) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 32647) %>% 
  mutate(event_date = dmy(event_date))
```

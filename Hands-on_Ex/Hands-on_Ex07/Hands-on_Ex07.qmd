## 7.0 Overview

In this hands-on exercise, I will be exploring two different analysis methods:

-   hierarchical cluster analysis; and

-   spatially constrained cluster analysis.

These methods are mainly used to help achieve Geographical Segmentaion. Geographical segmentation is the process of splitting a region into geographical units based on certain factors or variables. Thus, in this exercise, I will be using geographically referenced multivariate data to split a region into different homogeneous segments.

#### 7.0.1 Getting Started

In this exercise, the region of interest will be Shan State in Myanmar. I will be splitting this region into homogeneous segments on the basis of different means of Communication Technology: Radio, Television, Land Line Phone, Mobile Phone, Computer and Internet at home.

#### 7.0.2 The data

Two data sets will be used in this study. They are:

-   Myanmar Township Boundary Data (i.e.Â *myanmar_township_boundaries*) : This is a GIS data in ESRI shapefile format. It consists of township boundary information of Myanmar. The spatial data are captured in polygon features.

-   *Shan-ICT.csv*: This is an extract of [**The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Myanmar**](https://myanmar.unfpa.org/en/publications/2014-population-and-housing-census-myanmar-data-sheet) at the township level.

#### 7.0.3 Installing packages

Firstly, we will install the necessary packages needed for this exercise. The R packages needed for this exercise are as follows:

-   Spatial data handling

    -   **sf**, **rgdal** and **spdep**

-   Attribute data handling

    -   **tidyverse**, especially **readr**, **ggplot2** and **dplyr**

-   Choropleth mapping

    -   **tmap**

-   Multivariate data visualisation and analysis

    -   **coorplot**, **ggpubr**, and **heatmaply**

-   Cluster analysis

    -   **cluster**

    -   **ClustGeo**

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, rgdal, sfdep, tidyverse, tmap, coorplot, ggpubr, heatmaply, cluster, ClustGeo)
```

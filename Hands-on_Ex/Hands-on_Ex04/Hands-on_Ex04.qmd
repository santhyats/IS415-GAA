## 4.1 Overview

**Network constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (NetSPAA)** is a collection of spatial point patterns analysis methods specially developed to analyse spatial point event occuring on or alongside a network. The spatial point events include events such as locations of accidents, buildings, etc. The network, on the other hand, can be a road network or river network.

In this hands-on exercise, I will be using these functions of **spNetwork** package to derive **network kernel density estimation (NKDE)**, and perform network G-function and k-function analysis. Let's begin :)

## 4.2 The Datasets

In this Hands-On Exercise, we will analyse the distribution of childcare centers in the punggol planning area
